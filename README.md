# VoteMaster
Voting Master uses a weighted voting system.
Each memberâ€™s vote is based on their assigned weight (e.g., number of shares owned). This means members with a larger stake have more voting power.
For example:

- A shareholder with 70M shares has more voting influence than one with 10M shares.
